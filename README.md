This is based on [ch. 7 "Parsing JSON and XML Documents to Use Online APIs" of *Qt 5 Blueprints*](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/qt-5-blueprints/9781784394615/ch07.html). I can successfully compile it for both Linux and Android, demonstrating Qt's very powerful cross-platform abilities.

For an excellent video guide of Qt, see the YouTube playlist "[C++ Qt Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2D1942A4688E9D63)."
